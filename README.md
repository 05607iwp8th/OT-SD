READ ME!
-This is not an app rather than a output (there are many other apps but if you want to support me, then so be it. Plus it does not require an account or login so that is a bonus!
- Rights to change the code goes to the user (you!).
- Rights to the code go to Isaiah Pagnozzi, 8th Grade 😊
- In case of confrontations with teachers tell them ^^^

Installation guides:
1.	Install PyCharm 2020-1.0 from JetBrains™ Go to “https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows”  and click Community Edition Download, the firewall should kick in and try to block it, but don’t click off. Just wait (sometimes entering your email in the username slot can help…) alternatively you could get Microsoft’s visual code at “https://code.visualstudio.com/” and do the above.
2.	Complete the PyCharm setup
3.	Install the latest version of Python @”https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/” then scroll all the way down to the Files category😊. There should be a choice to click the “Windows x86 embeddable zip file (everything else will trigger the firewall and won’t be installed).
4.	Open PyCharm, unless it is already open, skip the addons then it should say no interpreter at the top but do not fret… in the top right corner, click file, then click new in the dropdown menu.
5.	Download the files from the GitHub link. Or you can copy and paste the code into your new project –faster
